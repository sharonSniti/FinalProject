## Introduction

People experience communication difficulties for a range of reasons, including learning/intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injuries, cerebral palsy and motor neuron disease. Digital solutions, such as communication boards, have been proven helpful in getting the message from those unable to speak or even write through conventional methods. However, most commercial digital boards are simply unaffordable for most families.
While Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) has been widely studied and utilized for individuals of all ages, in our project we primarily focused on children. We aimed to develop an improved AAC Board application, that will combine a set of unique features in order to best fit the needs of children with complex communication needs (CCN), designed to be used on both tablet and phone devices, supporting both iOS and Android platforms.
Our main project goal is to help children with different levels of CCN to enhance their communication and language (Hebrew) abilities. We aim to do so by empowering the frequency in which they will independently initiate requests to express their desires, needs and feelings using our application. Furthermore, our application not only serves as a standard communication board but also functions as an educational platform that enables each child to practice and develop their language and communication skills
